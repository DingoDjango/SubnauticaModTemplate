# Empty QMod Template
This is a simple template for Visual Studio. It helps you set up a QMods-based mod quickly and easily.

## Installation
- Download the zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/DingoDjango/SubnauticaModTemplate/releases) tab.
- Extract the zip to *Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates* or any equivalent Visual Studio Templates folder.
- That's it! You can begin working with the template.

## Functionality
- Use the "Subnautica_EmptyMod" template after clicking *Create new project...*
  - Remember to choose a project name and optionally a solution name!
- References and settings are pre-adjusted based on QMods v2.0.0 and above for the Subnautica Steam release.
  - If you aren't using Steam you will need to fix the project references.
- The project builds to a QMods folder in the main project directory, in both Debug and Release modes.
